doc:
  An EVSE port delivers electricity to a single EV charging inlet at a
  time.  Comprised of a software-controlled electrical contactor or
  circuit breaker.  Typically contained within an `evse-dispenser`, but
  may be contained within an `evse-powerConverter`.  More than one
  `evse-cable` may be connected to a single `evse-port`, however, only one
  may be energized at any given time.

  Note:  In the future we might add an entity that describes `evse-port`
  contained in an AC distribution panel.  This scenario is not common.

doc:
  An AC EVSE port delivers `ac` electricity to a single EV charging inlet
  at a time.  See `docHaystack::EVSE#port` chapter.

  Typically a max current or max power setpoint should reference an AC
  EVSE port, but not both.  Usually it is preferred to control an AC EVSE
  port using a max current setpoint.

  It is recommended to include electrical location related tags on
  electrical points that reference an AC EVSE port.  See
  `docHaystack::Meters#elecMeters` chapter for more details.

def: ^evseSession
is: ^dict
doc:
  Describes an event during which an `evse-port` can deliver power to an EV.
  The EVSE may need to authorize a user to initiate an `evseSession`.

  At minimum has the following data:
   - ts:  when the event was logged by the system of record
   - started:  when the event started
   - stopped:  when the event stopped
   - tx:  transaction ID for the event
   - targetRef:  reference to the `evse-port`
   - energyDelivered:  energy delivered during the `evseSession`
   - event:  marker tag
   - meterStart:  meter register's value at the beginning of the `evseSession`

  In the future additional data might be included, such as the means of
  EV charging session authorization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
def: ^evseStatus
is: ^str
tagOn: ^point
doc:
  Status of one or more `evse-port` reported by an EVSE.

  When applied to an `evse-port`, indicates the status of an EVSE port.

  When applied to an `evse-dispenser` or `evse-powerConverter`, indicates
  the status of one or more `evse-port` within an EVSE manufacturer's
  package.  In this case only the enum values available, unavailable,
  and fault apply.
enum:
  - available:  When the point references an `evse-port`, indicates the
    `evse-port` is available for recharging a vehicle.  During this
    condition none of the `evse-cable` that reference the `evse-port` are
    plugged into a vehicle charging inlet.  Also, a parked vehicle may
    prohibit another vehicle from recharging.

    When the point references `evse-dispenser` or `evse-powerConverter`,
    indicates `evse-port` within the EVSE manufacturer's package are
    available for an `evseSession` and may actively be in one.  Also, an
    `evse-port` may have another `evseStatus` based on its condition.
  - preparing:  After an `evse-port` is no longer available and before an
    `evseSession` begins.  Typically this condition applies during the
    authorization of an `evseSession`.  This value is deprecated in favor
    of the occupied value.
  - charging:  When there is an active `evseSession` and the contactor
    for the `evse-port` is closed.  This value is deprecated in favor of
    the occupied value.
  - suspendedEVSE:  When the `evse-port` is occupied and not within an
    active `evseSession` due to inavailability of power to deliver to the
    vehicle or an unsuccessful attempt to establish an `evseSession`.
    This value is deprecated in favor of the occupied value.
  - suspendedEV:  When a vehicle does not accept power being offered by
    the `evse-port` during an active `evseSession`.  This value is
    deprecated in favor of the occupied value.
  - finishing:  After an `evseSession` when the `evse-port` is still
    occupied.  This value is deprecated in favor of the occupied value.
  - occupied:  When an `evse-cable` that references the `evse-port` is
    plugged into a vehicle's charging inlet.  During this condition the
    `evse-port` may or may not be within an active `evseSession`.
  - reserved:  When the `evse-port` is dedicated to a specific user.
    During this condition only the intended user can authorize an
    `evseSession` with their vehicle.  An unauthorized user and their
    parked vehicle may prohibit an authorized user from recharging.
  - unavailable:  When the EVSE prohibits EV charging on the `evse-port`
    due to an applied software setting for the `evse-port` or EVSE
    manufacturer's package.
  - fault:  When the EVSE prohibits EV charging on the `evse-port` due to
    a fault condition within the `evse-port` or EVSE manufacturer's
    package.
