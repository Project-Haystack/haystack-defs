Overview [#overview]
*********************
An Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment (EVSE) delivers electricity via EVSE 
ports to charging inlets located on electric vehicles (EVs).  An EVSE may 
also be referred to as a charging station, charge point, or an EV charger.
The meaning of these names often vary and are subject to interpretation.

There are three commonly referred to [Types of EVSE]`#types`.  EVSE are 
modeled in Project Haystack using the `evse-assembly` conjunct.  See the 
chapter [Modeling EVSE]`#equip` for more details.

Types of EVSE [#types]
*****************************

**Level 1 AC EVSE**

Level 1 AC EVSE may deliver up to 2.5kW of AC power to the EV's charging 
inlet.  The EV's onboard converter transforms the inputted AC power to DC 
power, which is used to recharge the EV's battery.  This EVSE is only 
available within the North America market, adheres to the SAE J1772 Type 1 
or NACS EV charging specifications, and requires a 1-phase, 120V electrical 
input from a standard wall outlet.

**Level 2 AC EVSE**

Similar to the Level 1 AC EVSE, Level 2 AC EVSE delivers AC power to the 
EV's charging inlet.  However, the Level 2 AC EVSE is capable of delivering 
more AC power due to it's support for higher voltage, 1-phase, or 3-phase 
electrical inputs.  Faster recharging times are possible as a result.  This 
EVSE adheres to the SAE J1772 Type 1, SAE J1772 Type 2, NACS, or SAE J3078 
EV charging specifications depending on the region in the world and use case.

**Level 3 DC EVSE**

Level 3 DC EVSE delivers DC power directly to the EV's charging inlet, 
eliminating the need for a converter onboard the EV.  It is also referred to 
as a Direct Current Fast Charger (DCFC).  In some cases, such as when an EV 
has a battery pack that is greater than 500VDC, there is still a DC to DC 
converter onboard the vehicle to allow recharging the EV using an earlier 
generation Level 3 DC EVSE that is not capable of delivering more than 
500VDC output.

Typically Level 3 DC EVSE deliver more power and recharge EVs considerably 
faster than Level 1 or Level 2 AC EVSE.  This is because they convert AC 
power to DC power with fewer space, weight, and cost constraints than 
converters designed to be onboard an EV.  Level 3 DC EVSE adheres to the 
CCS1, CCS2, CHAdeMO, NACS, or MCS EV charging specifications depending on 
the region in the world and use case.

**Project Haystack's Use of EVSE Types** [#phUseOfEvseTypes]

It is often difficult to estimate how long it would take to recharge an EV
when referencing these EVSE types for reasons including: 

  - The range of power that each EVSE type may deliver has increased
  - Several available EVSE products may be considered a Level 2 AC and Level
  3 DC type simultaneously
  - These EVSE type definitions do not clearly convey what electrical input 
  and output specifications apply to the EVSE
  - Variety in the EV battery sizes
 
Presently Project Haystack does not describe EVSE types using standard 
tags.  Instead the following approach is taken to convey important related 
metadata:

  - Electrical input specifications for an `evse-assembly` are described
  using attributes
  - Electrical output specifications for an `evse-port` are described using
  attributes 
  - An `evse-port` is described to deliver AC or DC power to an EV's
  charging inlet using the `ac` or `dc` tag, respectively
  - An `evse-port` may only have the `ac` or `dc` tag, but not both 

Modeling EVSE [#equip]
*****************************
The below Figure shows the UML representation for `evse-assembly`:

![EVSE Assembly UML]`evseAssemblyUml.svg`

Refer [here]`#phUseOfEvseTypes` to how important metadata related to EVSE is 
captured  using:
  - Attributes on `evse-assembly` and `evse-port`
  - The `ac` or `dc` tag on `evse-port`

Each available electrical connection between an `evse-port` and an EV 
charging inlet may be modeled using `evse-cable`.  The type of the 
electrical connection will eventually be modeled as an attribute on 
`evse-cable`.  

Future Work [#future]
*****************************

The EV charging working group recently formed.  The definitions presented 
should be considered preliminary and subject to change.  We plan to add more 
definitions related to EV charging in the future.
