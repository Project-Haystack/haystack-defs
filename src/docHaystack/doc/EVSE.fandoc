Overview [#overview]
*********************
An Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment (EVSE) delivers electricity via EVSE
ports to charging inlets located on electric vehicles (EVs).  An EVSE may
also be referred to as a charging station, charge point, or an EV charger.
The meaning of these names often vary and are subject to interpretation
within the industry.

There are three commonly referred to [Types of EVSE]`#types`.  However,
EVSE are modeled in Project Haystack using various combinations of
`evse-powerConverter`, `evse-dispenser`, `evse-port`, and `evse-cable`.
See the chapter [Modeling EVSE]`#equip` for more details.

Types of EVSE [#types]
*****************************

Level 1 AC EVSE [#level1AcEvse]
================================

A Level 1 AC EVSE may deliver up to 2.5kW of AC power to an EV's charging
inlet.  The EV's onboard converter transforms the inputted AC power to DC
power, which is used to recharge the EV's battery.  This EVSE typically
requires a 1-phase, 120V electrical input from a standard wall outlet.

Level 2 AC EVSE [#level2AcEvse]
================================

Similar to a Level 1 AC EVSE, a Level 2 AC EVSE delivers AC power to an
EV's charging inlet.  However, a Level 2 AC EVSE is capable of delivering
more AC power due to it's support for a higher input voltage or a 3-phase
electrical input.  Faster recharging times are possible as a result.

Level 3 DC EVSE [#level3DcEvse]
================================

A Level 3 DC EVSE delivers DC power directly to an EV's charging inlet,
eliminating the need for a converter onboard an EV.  It is also referred to
as a Direct Current Fast Charger (DCFC).  In some cases, such as when an EV
has a battery pack that is greater than 500VDC, there is still a DC-to-DC
converter onboard the vehicle to allow recharging the EV using an earlier
generation Level 3 DC EVSE that is not capable of delivering more than
500VDC output.

Typically Level 3 DC EVSE deliver more power and recharge EVs considerably
faster than Level 1 or Level 2 AC EVSE.  This is because they convert AC
power to DC power with fewer space, weight, and cost constraints than
converters designed to be onboard an EV.

Tagging EVSE Types [#taggingEvseTypes]
=======================================

It is often difficult to estimate how long it would take to recharge an EV
when referencing these EVSE types, or levels, for reasons including:

  - The range of power that each EVSE type may deliver has increased in
  recent years
  - Several available EVSE products may be considered a Level 2 AC and Level
  3 DC type simultaneously
  - These EVSE type definitions do not clearly convey what electrical input
  and output specifications apply to the EVSE
  - Variety in EV battery sizes

Consequently, Project Haystack does not currently describe EVSE types, or
levels, using standard tags to avoid ambiguity or repeated data.

Modeling EVSE [#equip]
*****************************

EVSE Power Converter [#powerConverter]
======================================
An `evse-powerConverter` models the power modules used to convert an
electrical waveform to a `dc` form that is applied to a `dc-evse-port`.
It may be contained within an `evse-dispenser` or in a separate dedicated
equipment enclosure.  An `evse-powerConverter` can contain zero or more
`evse-port`.

EVSE Dispenser [#dispenser]
===========================
An `evse-dispenser` dispenses electricity to an EV.  It consists of a
physical EVSE enclosure and its contents to which an `evse-cable` attaches.
An `evse-dispenser` can contain zero or more `evse-port`.

EVSE Port [#port]
==========================
An EVSE port is modeled with the `evse-port` tags.  An `evse-port` delivers
electricity to a single EV charging inlet at a time.  More than one
`evse-cable` may be connected to a single `evse-port`, but only one may be
energized at a time.

Electrical output specifications for an `evse-port` are described using
attributes.  An `evse-port` is described to deliver AC or DC power to an
EV's charging inlet using the `ac` or `dc` tag, respectively.  An
`evse-port` may only have the `ac` or `dc` tag, but not both.

EVSE Cable [#cable]
==========================
An EVSE cable is modeled with the `evse-cable` tags.  An `evse-cable` models
the electrical cable between an `evse-port` and an EV charging inlet used
by an EV driver.  `evseCableType` distinguishes the type of cable.

Future Work [#future]
*****************************

The EV charging working group recently formed.  The definitions presented
should be considered preliminary and subject to change.  We plan to add more
definitions related to EV charging in the future.  Specifically, future work
will describe how to define attributes for `evse-equip` and may establish
entities that address pantograph, socket, and wireless EV charging
applications, which are less common.
